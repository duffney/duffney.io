Tethered. A single word that describes my relationship with technology. It means to connect. But it also means to tie with 
a rope or chain to restrict movement. And that’s what technology does to my mind. It connects and restricts me.

Restrict, what an odd choice of words, don’t you think? Technology is often thought of as freeing us from the limitations 
of the physical world. But what I’ve come to discover is that there is a cost associated with this connectedness. 

Tethering your phone to your laptop puts more demand on your phone. And so does keeping your mind connected to the digital world. 
It has a cost. Your payments are your productivity and happiness.
