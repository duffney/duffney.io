**Following Zero had some interesting consequences.**

Before yesterday I followed a modest amount of around 100 people. Which was plenty to have a constant stream of new information in my feed. And was what kept me on the platform the longest. I'd get a notification and then hit the feed. Cutting this off at the knees, I unfollowed everyone.

**It destroyed the appeal of the feed.** My feed is now an echo chamber of myself. Only occasionally pulling updates from `lists` I've created. It also cut my notifications in half. Because you have to follow people to subscribe to their notifications.

**Twitter is less appealing. But it's also less useful.** Even though I spent 3 hours on Twitter Monday it was fun. Yesterday I got bored quickly.

[@naval](https://twitter.com/naval) is on to something with `0 Following`. The low-level anxiety is gone. I didn't feel like I was missing out.

Perhaps _Following_ is just that. It's you willingly following along with how Twitter wants you to use their platform.

**Next**: _Increasing the signal to noise ratio._ Making Twitter useful again.
