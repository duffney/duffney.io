**Reading List**

2. [Cloud Native Patterns](https://www.manning.com/books/cloud-native-patterns)

**Skill up with Certs**

Certifications matter. Each major cloud vendor has made a tremendous investment in their certification tracks. It’s simple, they want you to be able to use their cloud. 

If you feel stuck. Or left behind in the cloud game, study, and crush some exams. It’s not the piece of paper that matters. It won’t make you an expert. But it will get you in the game and you’ll have something to show for it. 

In other words, [certifications don’t matter but they absolutely do matter](https://duffney.io/certifications-dont-matter-but-they-absolutely-do-matter/).

AWS

3. [AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/)

_I have a sysadmin background. And my recommendations reflect my background. I hold the AWS CCP, but then chose to pivot and go to Azure. I currently hold the AZ-103 & AZ-400._
